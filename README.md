# (Not so) Easy Go

Go is a wonderful language. It's easy to learn and a pleasure to use;
it has a great balance of flexibility and rigidity that allows me to be
productive without feeling like I'm building on quicksand.

But, like any other language, it has its share of edge cases,
idiosyncrasies and even inconsistencies that can leave you scratching
your head. The following is an attempt to catalog such bits of Go,
along with an attempt to explain them, so that I can understand them
better.

## Slices

### Underlying arrays matter

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s1 := []int{0, 1, 2}
	// Prints 3 (the size of the underlying array)
	fmt.Println(cap(s1))

	s2 := s1[0:2]
	// Prints 3 (s2 has the same underlying array as s1)
	fmt.Println(cap(s2))

	s2[0] = -1
	// Prints -1 (s2 has the same underlying array as s1)
	fmt.Println(s1[0])

	s2 = append(s2, 3)
	// Prints 3 (s2 still has the same underlying array as s2)
	fmt.Println(s1[2])

	s2 = append(s2, 4)
	s2[0] = 0
	// Prints -1 (s1 and s2 don't share underlying array anymore)
	fmt.Println(s1[0])
}
```
The last append (`s2 = append(s2, 4)`) takes `s2` over its capacity,
so Go creates a new underlying array for it.

### Slicing direction matters

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s1 := []int{0, 1, 2, 4}
	// Prints 4
	fmt.Println(cap(s1))

	s2 := s1[:2]
	// Prints 4
	fmt.Println(cap(s2))

	s2 = s2[:4]
	// Prints 4 (re-slicing upwards within capacity works)
	fmt.Println(s2[3])

	s2 = s1[1:]
	// Prints 3 (slicing off the bottom changes capacity)
	fmt.Println(cap(s2))

	s2 = s2[1:]
	// Prints 2
	fmt.Println(cap(s2))
}
```

Slicing off the top of a slice doesn't change its capacity and we can
re-slice back up to get the original length (and elements). However,
slicing off the botom changes the capacity (i.e. there's no way to get
the sliced off elements back).

## Arrays

Arrays are rarely used explicitly in Go. Usually you just create a
slice where other languages may use arrays. Go implicitly creates an
underlying array and takes care of deallocating it once the slice
stops using it.

### Array's length is part of its type

```Go
package main

func main() {
	var a1 [2]int
	var a2 [2]int
	var a3 [3]int
	// Works
	a1 = a2
	// Causes a compile-time error
	a1 = a3

	_ = a1
}
```

`a1 = a3` does not fall within any of the
[assignability](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Assignability) rules: `a1` and
`a3` have different underlying types, since an array's length is part
of its type.

### Arrays are value types

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a1 := [...]int{0, 1, 2, 3}

	a2 := a1

	a2[0] = 1

	// Prints 0
	fmt.Println(a1[0])
}
```

Unlike slices, arrays are value types, which means that passing an array
actually copies all of it, including the memory that holds the data.

## Interfaces

### Nil inside an interface is not equal to nil

```Go
package main

import "fmt"

type MyError struct{}

// Implements the error interface
func (me MyError) Error() string {
	return "my error"
}

func main() {
	var myErr *MyError
	var err error = myErr

	// Prints true
	fmt.Println(myErr == nil)

	// Prints false
	fmt.Println(err == nil)

	// Prints true
	fmt.Println(err.(*MyError) == nil)
}
```

Also, [this post](https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/wnH302gBa4I/m/zqcfBFPIBgAJ)
by a Go developer provides more context:
> ... we, probably incorrectly, chose to use the same identifier, `nil`, to
> represent the zero value both for pointers and for interfaces.

> If we do change something in this area for Go 2, which we probably
> won't, my preference would definitely be to introduce `nilinterface`
> rather than to further confuse the meaning of `r != nil`.

## Assignability Rules

### Numeric types are defined types

```Go
package main

func main() {
	type MyMap1 map[int]int
	type MyMap2 map[int]int

	var m1 MyMap1
	var m2 MyMap2
	var m map[int]int

	// Works
	m1 = m

	// Causes compile-time error
	m1 = m2

	type MyInt int

	var d1 MyInt
	var d2 int

	// Causes compile-time error
	d1 = d2

	// Avoid "declared but not used" errors
	_, _ = m1, d1
}
```
`m1 = m` works because it falls within the
[assignability](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Assignability) rules. In this
case, they both have identical underlying types and at least one of
them (`m`) does not have a [named type](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types).

`m1 = m2` causes a compilation error despite the identical underlying
types, because they both have defined types.

Finally, `d1 = d2` causes an error because `int` is also a named
typeâ€”predeclared types are considered named types according to
the spec, which also mentions this:

> To avoid portability issues all numeric types are defined types...
